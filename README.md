# GAM+Sync

Agentic Memory with Concept Design, Synchronizations, and Structural Enforcement.

GAM+Sync is a CLI tool (`gam`) for managing agentic and human-in-the-loop software development. It provides concepts (independent units of functionality), synchronizations (declarative inter-concept rules), region markers (structural namespace enforcement), and a validation pipeline — so coding agents can work reliably on large codebases.

Three failures compound in LLM-driven software development: context rot, illegibility and integrity failure. These share a structural root. The software lacks modularity that corresponds to functionality, lacks a compositional layer that makes inter-module behavior explicit, and lacks enforcement infrastructure that prevents autonomous agents from violating module boundaries.

GAM+Sync synthesizes four approaches that each solve a different face of this problem.

GAM+Sync uses a skeletal architecture file (arch.md) that agents use for orientation, region markers in source code that tag files with namespace paths, a two-command turn ritual (start/end) with a scratchpad turn memory field for cross-session continuity, and the principle that enforcement lives in tool commands rather than agent-remembered rules.

Concept Design and Synchronizations (Meng & Jackson, Onward! 2025) contributed the design methodology where concepts are independent services with purpose, state, typed actions, and operational principles. The synchronization language (when/where/then) declaratively connects concepts without creating dependencies. GAM+Sync adopts concept specifications, the synchronization engine with flow tokens for causal tracking, spec-first generation, and provenance-based debugging via sync attribution. Dropped elements—RDF/SPARQL storage, the Web bootstrap concept, and Turtle-format action records—were replaced by PostgreSQL JSONB, a CLI entry point, and a flow_log table.

GAM+Sync provides enforcement infrastructure: a dual-agent architecture (Memorizer auditor, Researcher coder), proposals as structured change requests with typed transitions, tiered validation (four tiers) with advisory locking on LTREE paths, correction briefings with typed error codes, Redis streams for inter-role queuing, and LTREE storage with ancestor-based invariant inheritance.

Harness Engineering (OpenAI, 2026) contributed operational learnings from shipping a million-line product with zero manually-written code. GAM+Sync adopts the docs/ directory as repo-local knowledge, execution plans as multi-turn artifacts with decision logs, iterative Tier 3 review loops, runtime validation (Tier 4), gardening agents for entropy management with quality grades, agent-actionable rejection messages, and a preference for boring, well-documented tools well-represented in training data.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
go build -o gam ./cmd/gam/

# Initialize (filesystem only, no DB required)
gam init --minimal

# Initialize (full: PostgreSQL + Redis)
export GAM_DATABASE_URL="postgres://localhost:5432/gamsync?sslmode=disable"
export GAM_REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
gam init

# Add a region and concept
gam region touch app.search --file src/search/search.go
gam concept add SearchSource --purpose "register and query torrent index providers" --spec search_source.json
gam concept assign SearchSource app.search --role implementation

# Start working
gam turn start --region app.search
# ... write code inside region markers ...
gam turn end --scratchpad "Added search adapter. TODO: add rate limiting."
```

## Core Abstractions

### Concepts

A concept is a self-contained unit of functionality with a purpose, state, actions, invariants, and an operational principle. Concepts have no dependencies on other concepts.

```
concept SearchSource [S]
purpose
  to register and query torrent index providers
state
  sources: set S
  name: S -> string
  endpoint: S -> url
  enabled: S -> boolean
actions
  register [source: S; name: string; endpoint: url] => [source: S]
  query [source: S; terms: string] => [results: []Result]
  disable [source: S] => [source: S]
invariants
  - rate_limit_positive: rate_limit > 0
  - name_unique: unique(name)
```

### Synchronizations

Synchronizations are declarative rules that compose concepts without creating dependencies:

```
sync FanOutSearch
when { Web/request[method:"search"; terms:?terms] => [request:?request] }
where { SearchSource: {?s enabled: true} }
then { SearchSource/query[source:?s; terms:?terms] }
```

### Region Markers

Region markers tag code with namespace paths, enabling structural enforcement:

```go
// @region:app.search.sources.btv2
package search

type BTv2Source struct { ... }

// @region:app.search.sources.btv2.adapter
func (s *BTv2Source) Query(terms string) ([]Result, error) { ... }
// @endregion:app.search.sources.btv2.adapter

// @endregion:app.search.sources.btv2
```

Comment style adapts to the language: `//` for Go/JS/Rust, `#` for Python/Ruby, `--` for SQL, `<!-- -->` for HTML.

## Validation Pipeline

Each tier gates the next:

| Tier | Name | Speed | What it checks |
|------|------|-------|----------------|
| 0 | Structural | Instant | Region exists, scope check, markers present |
| 1 | State Machine | Microseconds | Legal transitions, invariants, sync reference integrity |
| 2 | Integration | Seconds | Build, tests, evidence truthfulness (Dagger) |
| 3 | LLM Review | Seconds/iter | Architectural alignment, iterative feedback loop |
| 4 | Runtime | Minutes | Boot app, run operational principles live |

Tiers 0 and 1 are implemented. Tiers 2-4 are specified and stubbed for future implementation.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
